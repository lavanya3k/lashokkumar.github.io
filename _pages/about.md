I study glaciers and ice sheets from observations based on remote sensing and numerical modelling. From my background in remote sensing and glaciology, I process data from different satellites that includes the optical (Landsat, ASTER), SAR (ERS, EnviSAT, Sentinel-1) and gravimetry (GRACE).  For understanding the interactions between glaciers and atmosphere, I use climate datasets that are based on meteorological station observations and large mathematical models like the general circulation models (GCM) from CMIP5 and CMIP6 scenarios. 

The population of mountain glaciers is relatively small compared to the two large ice sheets. Glaciers are important since they have been rapidly decreasing over the last decades. My research involves understanding the mass balance sensitivities of mountain glaciers and ice sheets to climate change. 

-	Use of remote sensing data to understand to quantify the glacier mass balance.
-	Dynamics of glaciers: Importance of glacier velocities 
-	Future projections of  mass balance and its contribution to global sea-level rates.

My research has focused on different aspects of glaciers in response to climate change. Some of my current work includes:
1.	Modelling of glaciers using GRACE gravimetric data for present and future rates of ice loss. 
2.	Understanding the spatial and temporal change in glaciers from ice velocities, derived from optical and radar satellites. 
3.	Relationship between glacier observational climate datasets
