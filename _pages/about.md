I am a geospatial data scientist and educator specializing in Earth Science, with a research background in remote sensing, geospatial techniques, and glaciology. My work focuses on developing and automating remote sensing processes for geospatial applications, including glacier dynamics, numerical modeling, and machine learning techniques to estimate global sea-level change.
In addition to research, I am an experienced educator in Earth Science. I have served as a lecturer, (equivalent to Assistant professor of Teaching) for Earth Science courses and have mentored students at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). With a combined experience in re-search and teaching following my Ph.D., I am dedicated to advancing scientific understanding and fostering the next generation of Earth scientists.

My research contributes to the understanding of climate change from quantification of glacier melt and dynamics using satellite remote sensing and mathematical approaches. The primary goal of my work is understanding mass loss rates (sea-level estimates) using a combination of satellite remote sensing and numerical modeling. I have developed an unique glacier-climate model, in which I use satellite gravity measurements from GRACE satellites to determine the ice melt rates from Arctic glaciers, and estimate the contribution of ice melt in terms of sea-level rates until 2100 under CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate scenarios. <br>

Another part of my work deals with the development and analysis of  long-term (temporal) ice-flow movements (glacier dynamics) from repeat satellite images. Based on my background in remote sensing, I enjoy processing datasets from different satellites that includes the optical (Landsat, ASTER), SAR (ERS, EnviSAT, Sentinel-1) and gravimetry (GRACE). From high spatial and temporal resolution of glacier velocities, my research investigates the role of topography and climate in the ice flow movements from glaciers. <br> 

My interests are inclined towards Arctic and mountain (High Mountain Asia) glaciers for two known reasons: There are relatively small compared to the ice sheets, but are highly sensitive to climate change given the polar amplification. And, they are the hotspots of global warming. Therefore, my research objectives are categorized into the following broad topics, <br>
(i) Estimating glacier mass loss and dynamics using remote sensing satellites. <br>
(ii) Projections of glacier mass loss (sea-level rates) until 2100. <br>
(iii) Understanding the relationship between climate and topography with glacier changes. <br>
