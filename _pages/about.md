I am a <b> Research Scientist </b> and educator in Earth Science, with background in remote sensing, geospatial techniques, glaciology and machine learning. My work focuses on developing and automating remote sensing processes for geospatial applications, including glacier dynamics, numerical modeling, and machine learning techniques to estimate global sea-level change.
In addition to research, I am an experienced educator in Earth Science. In my previous role as a lecturer (equivalent to Assistant professor of Teaching), I taught Earth Science courses and mentored several students at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). With a combined experience in research and teaching following my Ph.D., I am committed to advancing scientific understanding and fostering the next generation of Earth scientists. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; My research contributes to the understanding of climate change from quantification of glacier melt and dynamics using satellite remote sensing and mathematical approaches. The goal of my work is understanding mass loss rates (sea-level estimates) using a combination of satellite remote sensing and numerical modeling. I have developed an unique glacier-climate model, in which I use satellite gravity measurements from GRACE satellites to determine the ice melt rates from Arctic glaciers, and estimate the contribution of ice melt in terms of sea-level rates until 2100 under CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate scenarios. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Another part of my work deals with the development and analysis of  long-term (temporal) ice-flow movements (glacier dynamics) from repeat satellite images. Based on my background in remote sensing, I enjoy processing datasets from different satellites that includes the optical (Landsat, ASTER), SAR (ERS, EnviSAT, Sentinel-1) and gravimetry (GRACE). From high spatial and temporal resolution of glacier velocities, my research investigates the role of topography and climate in the ice flow movements from glaciers. <br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp; My research objectives are categorized into the following broad topics, <br>
(i) Estimating glacier mass loss and dynamics using remote sensing satellites. <br>
(ii) Projections of glacier mass loss (sea-level rates) until 2100. <br>
(iii) Understanding the relationship between climate and topography with glacier changes. <br>
