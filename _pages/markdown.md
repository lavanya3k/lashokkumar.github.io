My academic experience in Earth science is a combination of research, teaching and service. Being a first-gen college graduate, I volunteer activities that align with my core values (from high school), and I strive to promote diversity in STEM through my service. My interests are science communication and engagement through leadership activities. <br>

I am a co-chair (2019 - present) for a non-profit and volunteer run organization called USAPECS (United States Association of polar early-career (ECR) scientists). 
* I am responsible for coordinating events and planning activities as a co-lead at USAPECS.
* As a co-lead, we aim to galvanise the US polar research community by organizing local and regional events for Early Career Researchers that provide United States-centric training and resources to early career polar researchers, and facilitating education and outreach opportunities. <br>

I have been an outreach coordinator at AWG (Association of Women Geoscientists), Southern Arizona chapter in Tucson (2018 - 2021) to develop and support university policies and practices that promote equity, diversity and inclusivity of all gender identities and to increase advancement opportunities for underrepresented minorities. 

* We aim to illustrate that college, higher education or working in a STEM field is a possible future for girls and under-represented minority students. 
* Through the program at AWG, we educate the campus community about CSW's (Commission of Status about the Women) work and objectives. 
* We provide leadership and advancement opportunities for women and/or under-represented groups in STEM,  educating the campus community about CSWâ€™s work, and conducting seminars.  <br>
